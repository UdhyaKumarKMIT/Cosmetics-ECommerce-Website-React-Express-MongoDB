Farthest Smaller Right
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 50.08%Submissions: 16K+Points: 4
You are given an array arr[]. For each element at index i (0-based indexing), find the farthest index j to the right (i.e., j > i) such that arr[j] < arr[i]. If no such index exists for a given position, return -1 for that index. Return the resulting array of answers.Farthest Smaller Right
